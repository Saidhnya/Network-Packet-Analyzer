The script uses the scapy library, which is a powerful packet manipulation tool for Python.
The packet_callback function is defined to analyze each packet captured by the sniffer.
It checks if the packet contains an IP header (IP in packet).
If the packet is a TCP or UDP packet (TCP or UDP in packet), it extracts relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, source and destination ports, and payload data.
Finally, it prints out the analyzed information.
Make sure to run this script with appropriate permissions, as sniffing network packets may require administrative privileges. Additionally, ensure that you have permission to monitor the network traffic you are analyzing, as unauthorized interception of network packets can be illegal and unethical. This tool should only be used for educational purposes and in environments where you have explicit permission to monitor the network traffic.
